## Implement MVCC for Python Pickle

Implementing Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) for Python objects serialized with pickle involves creating a system where each object can have multiple versions, each representing the state of the object at a different point in time. 

MVCC is a concurrency control method used to provide concurrent access to the database and to enhance performance by allowing transactions to use old snapshots of data.
